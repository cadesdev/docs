Here are the common errors occuring during the alpha ide setup and how to navigate them.

## Generated code error
Run `flutter pub get` if the project is not compiled and you see red screens.
Initial code will have some errors related to icon names, you can fix them or remove them and run the project.

Sometimes the agent will try to use icons that are not present, we are using lucide icons, you can refer the docs 
for lucide to find appropriate icons if you wish to edit

When you log in to the ide for the first time you might see this error, when you first try to press lets go on the cades agent extension.
To get around this just refresh the page and try again to go through the welcome screen and press let's go. Should be fixed.
If still facing issues contact for support in the community

## Quitting the Cades server
Before exiting the server press 'q' on the cades run command to exit the preview hot reload. If unable to run the cades run command again for a different project, contact support.
