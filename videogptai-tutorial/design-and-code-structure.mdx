## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Designing with Cades

First, describe your app idea to Cades and let it generate the initial screens.

  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen

For VideoGPTAI, the following screens were created:

- Home Screen (template selection)
- Library Screen (user's videos)
- Review Screen (video preview)
- Settings Screen (user profile)
- Login Screen (authentication)

Click on the `Finalize Designs & Generate Code` button to generate the code for your mobile app.

### Step 2: Understanding the Code Structure

When you generate code from your designs, you get a complete Flutter project structured in a way that's easy to work with. In the `lib` folder, we have these main parts:
- **common**: This folder contains shared elements like app constants, which are used throughout the app to maintain consistency and avoid hardcoding values.
- **pages**: This folder contains all our screen designs. Each screen is represented by a Dart file, making it easy to manage and update individual screens.
- **styles**: This folder includes our theme file, which keeps all our design choices consistent across the app. It defines colors, fonts, and other styling elements.
- **main.dart**: This is the entry point of the app, where all the components are connected and the app is initialized.

Now that we understand the structure, let's start updating our app...

### Step 3: Basic Project Configuration

Configure your app's identity with the following prompt:

<Note>
  The project package name should match with the name of the android app in firebase console. In this case, it is `com.videogptai.android`.

```bash
Change the name and description of the project in pubspec, and update all imports in main.dart and use the change_app_package_name to update it
name in pubspec should be in lowercase and underscore

My project name is "videogptai"
Description: "AI-powered video creation app"
My project package name will be "com.videogptai.android"
```
