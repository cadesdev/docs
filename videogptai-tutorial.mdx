## Overview

Learn how to build a complete, production-ready mobile app using Cades, the world's first AI mobile app developer. This tutorial will walk you through creating VideoGPTAI, a video creation app that's currently live on app stores.

<Note>
  Before starting, make sure you have a Firebase account and basic understanding of development concepts.
</Note>

## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Designing with Cades

First, describe your app idea to Cades and let it generate the initial screens. For VideoGPTAI, the following screens were created:

- Home Screen (template selection)
- Library Screen (user's videos)
- Review Screen (video preview)
- Settings Screen (user profile)
- Login Screen (authentication)

Click on the `Finalize Designs & Generate Code` button to generate the code for your mobile app.

### Step 2: Understanding the Code Structure

<Card title="Understanding Generated Code Structure" icon="folder-tree">
```
lib/
├── common/
│   ├── constants.dart
├── main.dart
├── pages/
│   ├── home_screen.dart
│   ├── library_screen.dart
│   ├── login_screen.dart
│   ├── onboarding_screen.dart
│   ├── review_video_screen.dart
│   └── settings_screen.dart
└── styles/
    └── theme.dart
```
</Card>

When you generate code from your designs, you get a complete Flutter project structured in a way that's easy to work with. In the `lib` folder, we have these main parts:
- **common**: This folder contains shared elements like app constants, which are used throughout the app to maintain consistency and avoid hardcoding values.
- **pages**: This folder contains all our screen designs. Each screen is represented by a Dart file, making it easy to manage and update individual screens.
- **styles**: This folder includes our theme file, which keeps all our design choices consistent across the app. It defines colors, fonts, and other styling elements.
- **main.dart**: This is the entry point of the app, where all the components are connected and the app is initialized.

Now that we understand the structure, let's start updating our app...

### Step 3: Basic Project Configuration

Configure your app's identity with the following prompt:

<Note>
  The project package name should match with the name of the android app in firebase console. In this case, it is `com.videogptai.android`.
</Note>

```bash
Change the name and description of the project in pubspec, and update all imports in main.dart and use the change_app_package_name to update it
name in pubspec should be in lowercase and underscore

My project name is "videogptai"
Description: "AI-powered video creation app"
My project package name will be "com.videogptai.android"
```

## Firebase Integration

### Step 1: Firebase Project Setup

<Steps>
  1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
  2. Add an Android app with your package name (Used `com.videogptai.android` in this example)
  3. Download the `google-services.json` file
</Steps>

### Step 2: Firebase Configuration

Use this prompt to integrate Firebase:

```bash
Integrate firebase into the project
```

When prompted, paste your `google-services.json` file contents into the chat.

### Step 3: Authentication Setup

Let's install the social_auth_btn_kit package to add pre-styled authentication buttons for a professional look:

```bash
flutter pub add social_auth_btn_kit
```
Now prompt the following to add google sign in functionality:

```bash
Create a login page for my app, it should have google sign in for now, add the methods in auth service for google sign in
the login page should have the name of the app in center and then the google sign in button is used from social_auth_btn_kit package add the google sign btn reference
<example_auth_button>
SocialAuthBtn.facebook(
                variant: FacebookTypeVariants.outlined,
                onPressed: () {
                  debugPrint("DEBUG: Facebook Btn Pressed");
                },
              ),
<example_auth_button>
```
### Step 4: Settings Page

Let's create a settings page, which will display the user's profile information and provide a logout option. This page will be accessible from the home screen and give users control over their account settings.

```bash
Create a settings page and link it with the home page and give the logout option and show the current user details in the settings page for now
```

### Step 5: Loading State

Let's create a loading state for the app to provide visual feedback during authentication:

```bash
In the login page show loading when google sign in is tapped and then when sign in is complete redirect to onboarding page, check logic on main.dart
```
