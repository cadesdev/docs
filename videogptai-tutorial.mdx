## Overview

Learn how to build a complete, production-ready mobile app using Cades, the world's first AI mobile app developer. This tutorial will walk you through creating VideoGPTAI, a video creation app that's currently live on app stores.

<Note>
  Before starting, make sure you have a Firebase account and basic understanding of development concepts.
</Note>

## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Designing with Cades

First, describe your app idea to Cades and let it generate the initial screens.

  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

For VideoGPTAI, the following screens were created:

- Home Screen (template selection)
- Library Screen (user's videos)
- Review Screen (video preview)
- Settings Screen (user profile)
- Login Screen (authentication)

Click on the `Finalize Designs & Generate Code` button to generate the code for your mobile app.

### Step 2: Understanding the Code Structure

│   └── settings_screen.dart
└── styles/
    └── theme.dart
```

  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

When you generate code from your designs, you get a complete Flutter project structured in a way that's easy to work with. In the `lib` folder, we have these main parts:
- **common**: This folder contains shared elements like app constants, which are used throughout the app to maintain consistency and avoid hardcoding values.
- **pages**: This folder contains all our screen designs. Each screen is represented by a Dart file, making it easy to manage and update individual screens.
- **styles**: This folder includes our theme file, which keeps all our design choices consistent across the app. It defines colors, fonts, and other styling elements.
- **main.dart**: This is the entry point of the app, where all the components are connected and the app is initialized.

Now that we understand the structure, let's start updating our app...

### Step 3: Basic Project Configuration

Configure your app's identity with the following prompt:

<Note>
  The project package name should match with the name of the android app in firebase console. In this case, it is `com.videogptai.android`.
</Note>

  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

```bash
Change the name and description of the project in pubspec, and update all imports in main.dart and use the change_app_package_name to update it
name in pubspec should be in lowercase and underscore

My project name is "videogptai"
Description: "AI-powered video creation app"
My project package name will be "com.videogptai.android"
```

## Adding Authentication

  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

### Step 1: Authentication Setup

Let's install the social_auth_btn_kit package to add pre-styled authentication buttons for a professional look:

```bash
flutter pub add social_auth_btn_kit
```
Now prompt the following to add google sign in functionality:

```bash
Create a login page for my app, it should have google sign in for now, add the methods in auth service for google sign in
the login page should have the name of the app in center and then the google sign in button is used from social_auth_btn_kit package add the google sign btn reference
<example_auth_button>
SocialAuthBtn.facebook(
                variant: FacebookTypeVariants.outlined,
                onPressed: () {
                  debugPrint("DEBUG: Facebook Btn Pressed");
                },
              ),
<example_auth_button>
```
### Step 2: Settings Page

Let's create a settings page, which will display the user's profile information and provide a logout option. This page will be accessible from the home screen and give users control over their account settings.

```bash
Create a settings page and link it with the home page and give the logout option and show the current user details in the settings page for now
```

### Step 3: Loading State

Let's create a loading state for the app to provide visual feedback during authentication:

```bash
In the login page show loading when google sign in is tapped and then when sign in is complete redirect to onboarding page, check logic on main.dart
```

## Adding go_router Navigation

Using this prompt We were able to migrate the navigation stack of the project, to better manage any redirections for login checks, we want to protect pages that shouldn't be accessible to user without login

  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

```bash
Integrate go_router package for my app migrate all navigation to go_router
```

Add a simple redirect logic to the onboarding screen
```bash
In login screen when login is successful you need to go to the onboarding screen
```

## Integrating Firebase
### Step 1: Firebase Project Setup

<Steps>
  1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
  2. Add an Android app with your package name (Used `com.videogptai.android` in this example)
  3. Download the `google-services.json` file
</Steps>

### Step 2: Firebase Configuration

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVRU5ofZ0Ec?si=KvHO7OAxk9qBenKE"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

Use this prompt to integrate Firebase:

```bash
Integrate firebase into the project
```

When prompted, paste your `google-services.json` file contents into the chat.

## Refactoring Components

```bash
Extract the template card in a seperate file for refactor save it in a components folder
```

  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

## API Integration

### Step 1: Network Layer Setup
Let's create a dependency injection folder using get_it package to manage API instances and follow clean architecture principles. This centralized approach helps avoid duplicating API instances across the codebase.

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVRU5ofZ0Ec?si=KvHO7OAxk9qBenKE"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

```bash
in the di folder /injection.dart Use get_it to setup the dependency injection graph of the project and call this in the main function for now import dio for network calls and set it up as a singleton dependency
```

### Step 2: API Client Configuration

After setting up Dio and dependency injection, we'll create a centralized API client class to handle all network requests efficiently and maintain clean architecture principles.

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVRU5ofZ0Ec?si=KvHO7OAxk9qBenKE"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

```bash
I want to integrate api into the app use retrofit to do the same
my base api url is 'https://api.videogptai.com/api' setup the retrofit class in api folder inject the api in the injection file in di use the singleton dio
```

### Step 3: First API Integration
Let's now integrate our first API, with this prompt:
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Integrate Templates API">
```bash
Integrate GET https://api.videogptai.com/api/en/video/getTemplates
Integrate in the home page with templates

                    "name": "Ava"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 4: Authentication Header Setup

Add authentication to API requests.

This will integrate the library api for the videos user has created with the existing UI.

### Step 6: Repeat the same for all APIs
Repeat the same process to integrate all the APIs.
<Tip>
  You can use the same prompt for all the APIs, just change the api url and the sample response.
</Tip>

Ask Cades to create buttons, pages, sheets, drawers, etc. based on the design you have in mind, and add functionality to them.

## Adding RevenueCat
Integrating RevenueCat into your app allows you to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions efficiently.

<Info>
Initial Setup:
  - Sign up at RevenueCat and create a new project
  - Define your in-app products and subscription offerings in the RevenueCat dashboard. Ensure these match the products set up in your Google Play and Apple App Store accounts
  - Obtain the API keys for your project from the RevenueCat dashboard. You'll need these to configure the SDK in your app
</Info>

Integrate subscription functionality:

```bash
Integrate revenue cat in the project, here are the api keys..
```
Continue chatting with Cades to add the subscription flow to the app.
